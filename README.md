# Special Focus: Test Driven Development (TDD) and coding with confidence
-After reading a book entitled, "Test Driven Development" by Kent Beck, I was very curious with the idea of building test before coding, building your program about test, and making strong documentation. I was interested by the idea of building confidence in your code by creating test first before oding. This goes against how many people program, which is usually, program first and test later.

# The End Result
After finishing this project, I can see the frustration many software developers come across with following TDD, but I like the confidence and safety that TDD helps create with one's project. Creating meaningful test and strong documentation can go a very long way. <p>

I will be implementing TDD with my future projects whenever possible.
